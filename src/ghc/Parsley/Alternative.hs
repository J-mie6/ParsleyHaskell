Module      : Parsley.Alterative
Description : The @Alternative@ combinators
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Jamie Willis
Stability   : stable

This modules contains the @Alternative@ combinators that would normally be found in
@Control.Applicative@. However, since Parsley makes use of staging, the signatures
of these combinators do not correctly match the signatures of those in base Haskell (due to a lack
of @Applicative@ constraint).

This combinator is similar to @(`<|>`)@, except it allows both branches to differ in type by
producing a co-product as a result.

@option x p@ first tries to parse @p@ and, if it fails without consuming input, will return
@x@ as a result.

{-|
@optionally p x@ will try to parse @p@ and will always return @x@. If @p@ fails having consumed
input, then this combinator will fail.

{-|
Attempts to parse a given parser, and will always return @()@. (See `optionally`)

optional :: Parser a -> Parser ()
optional = flip optionally UNIT

{-|
Tries to parse each of the given parsers in turn until one of them succeeds using @(`<|>`)@. If
given the empty list, it will fail unconditionally.

choice :: [Parser a] -> Parser a
choice = foldr (<|>) empty

{-|
Tries to parse a given parser, returning its result in @Just@ if it succeeds and @Nothing@ if it
fails having not consumed input.

maybeP p = option (makeQ Nothing [||Nothing||]) (makeQ Just [||Just||] <$> p)

{-|
The combinator @someTill p end@ will try and parse @p@ as many times as possible so long as @end@
cannot be successfully parsed. It will return the results from the successful parses of @p@.
